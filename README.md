Introduction
Fine-tuning large language models can be resource-intensive. LoRA and QLoRA offer efficient methods to adapt these models by training only a small subset of parameters or by leveraging quantization techniques. This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune the LLAMA 2 model using these techniques.

Features
LoRA and QLoRA Integration: Efficient fine-tuning by training a subset of parameters or using quantization.
Custom Dataset Compatibility: Adapt LLAMA 2 to specific datasets for tailored performance.
Detailed Configuration: Customize training parameters to suit your needs.
End-to-End Pipeline: Complete process from dataset loading to model training and inference.
Requirements
Python 3.8+
CUDA-enabled GPU for training
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llama2-finetune-lora-qlora.git
cd llama2-finetune-lora-qlora
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -q accelerate==0.21.0 peft==0.4.0 bitsandbytes==0.40.2 transformers==4.31.0 trl==0.4.7
Usage
Load Dataset: Specify the dataset to use for fine-tuning.
Configure Parameters: Adjust training and model parameters as needed.
Run Training: Execute the training script or notebook.
Inference: Use the fine-tuned model for generating text or other NLP tasks.
Example
Training: Open the Jupyter notebook (fine_tune_llama2.ipynb) and run all cells, or run the script directly:

bash
Copy code
python fine_tune_llama2.py
Inference: Generate text with the fine-tuned model:

python
Copy code
from transformers import pipeline

prompt = "Write me a 1000 words essay about deez nuts.?"
pipe = pipeline(task="text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, max_length=200)
result = pipe(f"<s>[INST] {prompt} [/INST]")
print(result[0]['generated_text'])
